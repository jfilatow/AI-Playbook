# Archived Content

This directory contains content that has been moved out of the main AI Playbook as it falls outside the playbook's focused scope on AI-assisted software delivery.

## Why Was Content Archived?

The MYOB AI Playbook is focused specifically on **AI-assisted software development and delivery**. Content in this archive represents general technical standards, architecture patterns, and platform guidance that belongs in the **MYOB Architecture Codex** instead.
