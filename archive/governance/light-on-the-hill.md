# Light on the Hill

## What is a Light on the Hill (LOTH)?

A Light on the Hill (LOTH) is a domain-level technical strategy - a technical vision together with the key steps expected to be taken to realise the vision. The 'light' embodies a destination and the visibility of the steps towards it, and the 'hill' embodies the effort and the challenges we work expected to confront as we to reach the destination.

MYOB domains use the practice of LOTH to regularly review and assess their progress towards a target state for the systems they own. LOTH refers to both the regular planning activity and the captured document or artefact.

## Why do we have a LOTH?

The LOTH enables teams to make decisions in everyday work, aligning those decisions with the steps towards the target state. A LOTH also enables evolution by regular consideration of new methods, tools, and technology that are emerging.

It's an important part of onboarding new team members and explaining to teams in other domains the technical direction.

Being involved in developing the LOTH gives people a shared understanding and clarity of technical direction for systems in the domain.

It also gives a team a common language and shared understanding of their domain and can simplify cross-domain discussions.

The LOTH for a domain is developed and maintained by the domain team members, giving autonomy to the domain but allowing for alignment with wider MYOB.

## How do we use a LOTH?

Typically Engineering Managers are accountable for ensuring the LOTH is regularly reviewed and shared. Other senior technical people are responsible for helping create and maintain the LOTH. All team members may participate and contribute to its content.

Each domain holds a regular LOTH session with cross-functional representation from the domain teams including engineering leadership and relevant architects. The cadence should be determined by the domain themselves and is an independent review process to any other planning activity. As guidance when starting your LOTH, you should aim to review no later than monthly.

These sessions review our understanding of the current and target state, review progress towards or away from the target, and incorporate any new discoveries – for example new product or platform services that can be used. Evolving the LOTH as needed.

The outcome of the sessions will be a shareable LOTH document e.g. an online whiteboard or wiki page. A LOTH should be a lightweight document, containing just enough information for readers to understand what is planned to be done and why. It should not capture the 'how' or 'when'. It should avoid going into needless information.

When new people join the domain, you should include a discussion of the LOTH during their onboarding. This will give them an understanding of the direction of the systems they will be working on.

## What templates or resources can help us build the LOTH?

The [LOTH toolkit](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/l/cp/Ba8HuZWc) is a set of resources to support teams to create, maintain and refresh the technical vision and practical next steps for their domain/s (including systems & sometimes platforms). These practical resources include detailed guidance for LOTH owners (e.g. architects, engineering managers) and facilitators. Use these resources and adapt them to create the technical vision and next steps for your domain.

## What do we capture in the LOTH?

The LOTH should at minimum contain an assessment of the current state, an illustration of the ideal target state, and some next steps to increment towards the target state.

| Section | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Assessment of current state | What are our systems, components, and APIs? What are the main issues and pain points with what we have now? What is the impact in terms of customer experience and/or business outcomes? Suggested format: system diagrams, annotated with issues and pain points |
| Illustration of the target state | Given what we know now, what does the ideal target state for our systems look like? How would the target state address the issues and pain points we’ve identified? How would the target state improve our customer experience and/or business outcomes? Suggested format: system diagrams annotated with description of features and benefits |
| Next steps to increment towards the target state | Describe key steps that will take our current systems and deliver the target state. How does each step deliver some benefit? |
