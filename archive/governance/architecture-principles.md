# Architecture Principles

# What constitutes Architecture

> Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building. It functions as a blueprint for the system and the developing project, laying out the tasks necessary to be executed by the design teams.

# What are Architecture Principles?

Before describing the application of Architecture Principles, it's worth framing what a Principle is when talking about architecture

* a fundamental truth or proposition that guide the development of the architecture and the systems that underpin it.

Architecture principles are concepts that describe what domains/teams value in their architecture.

An architecture principle is carefully worded to be easy to understood and remembered. They guide decision making within teams and are not strict rules.

Architecture principles are:

**Constructive** - The principle has a definite purpose, provides specific guidance, and guides decision making.

**Reasoned** - The principle is strongly motivated by business drivers, goals, and other principles. It's rational, logical, and consistent.

**Well-articulated** -  The principle is clearly written so that all the necessary stakeholders comprehend it.

**Testable** - Valuable principles are long lived. To be useful, a principle must be capable of being assessed objectively, to see whether it's been adhered to and, if no, where the exceptions are.

**Relevant** - They must apply to your domain and or team. Sometimes using other teams principles as a starting point is okay but remove any that do not apply.

Using them should assist in:
* Assist in technical decision making across domains / verticals / teams
* Creating [Light on the Hills](./light-on-the-hill.md)
* Creating [Solution Design](./solution-design/README.md)

When departing from Architecture Principles the reasons should be captured (for example, an architecture decision record (ADR)). These can also become moments to review and improve the principles.

# Why do we have Architecture Principles?

Architectural principles provide several key benefits.

* Encourages our engineering teams to be autonomous and feel empowered to make decisions by helping establish boundaries and priorities
* Can help align theory and practice by providing guidance around the most important architectural considerations
* Helps bring a shared understanding between cross functional stakeholders which assists with design decisions
* Assists with uplifting system quality by providing guidance on architectural direction
* Helps teams define and drive [Light on the Hills](../process-and-governance/light-on-the-hill.md)


Domains and teams should take the time to properly develop, capture and communicate architectural principles. Review them regularly (at least annually) and include communicating them to new team members via onboarding.
