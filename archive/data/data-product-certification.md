# Data Product Certification?

---

Certification of the data product empowers anyone within the organisation to use it confidently and without reservation. The metrics generated by this data product are rigorously verified, monitored, and maintained on a regular basis. This process fosters a culture of Trust in Metrics across the organisation.

The certification of a data product is achieved after following the guidelines outlined on this Confluence page. Several stakeholders are involved in this certification approval process.

**Data Product Producer**: The data product producer is responsible for getting the data product certified. They need to gather the other stakeholders, follow the certification process, and make necessary amendments until all stakeholders agree to the certification.

<!-- vale proselint.GenderBias = NO -->
**Data Steward**: A Data Steward is someone with domain knowledge who has a direct interest in and use of the data metrics generated from the data product. Some roles that can take up a Data Steward role are product managers, finance managers, etc.
<!-- vale proselint.GenderBias = YES -->
<!-- vale Microsoft.GenderBias = YES -->

**Date Team Member**:  Participates in a peer review process during the data product certification to ensure technical accuracy and adherence to standards.

**Governance Team Member**: Provides the approval on the certification process, ensuring all governance standards and protocols are met.

Certification ensures that the data product meets quality and integrity standards, creating trust and enabling confident decision-making across the organisation. This structured approach to data product certification involves defining quality metrics, setting up monitoring processes, performing regular data quality checks, and ensuring that all certification steps are documented and followed rigorously.

## A Framework for Data Product Certification

For the data product certification, characteristics of a data product need to be measured across several dimensions: what, why, where, how, and who.

**What**: This dimension explains the characteristic itself. For example, if the characteristic is "trustable," it refers to the quality and integrity standards that the data product needs to meet.

**Why**: This dimension explains the reason behind implementing the characteristic. Continuing with the example of "trustable," the reason for this characteristic would be to ensure confident decision-making and to reduce the cost of experimentation by maintaining consistent and reliable data quality.

**Where**: This dimension describes the tools and platforms where the characteristic can be implemented and checked. For instance, "trustable" characteristics can be verified using data quality tools and governance frameworks.

**How**: This dimension outlines the specific steps that need to be followed to implement the characteristic. For "trustable," the steps might include defining quality metrics, setting up monitoring processes, and performing regular data quality checks.

**Who**: This dimension identifies the stakeholders involved in certifying that the characteristic is properly implemented. For "trustable," these stakeholders could include data product owners, data quality analysts, and governance teams.
