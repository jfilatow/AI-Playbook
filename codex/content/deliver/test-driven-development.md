# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach in which tests are written before the actual code. It’s a technique that follows the “Red, Green, Refactor” cycle:

* **Red:** Write a failing test.

* **Green:** Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass.

* **Refactor:** Clean up the code while keeping the tests green.

## Benefits of TDD

* **Quality Assurance:** TDD ensures that the system is thoroughly tested. It helps catch bugs early in the development cycle, which reduces costs.

* **Simplified Debugging:** When a test fails, you know exactly where to look for the issue.

* **Improved Design:** Writing tests first forces you to think about the system design before writing the code.

* **Documentation:** Tests serve as documentation because they clearly state what the code should do.

## Techniques for Effective TDD

* **Write the minimum code:** The goal is to make the test pass with the simplest code possible. Don’t think about the perfect solution, just make the test pass.

* **Incremental Development:** Develop the system incrementally and iteratively. Start with a simple version of the system and gradually add more functionality.

* **Refactor Regularly:** Refactoring is not an optional step. Regular refactoring keeps the code clean and easy to understand.

* **Test Isolation:** Each test should be independent of the others. This makes it easier to pinpoint problems when a test fails.
