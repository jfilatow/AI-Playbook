## A Note on the Table of Contents Links

The Table of Contents links need to be modified with the confluence page URL to create "Confluence" in page links to anchors. These will not work in markdown but will be rendered correctly in Confluence.

Furthermore, the Anchors (e.g. "#References") Need to be Confluence anchors rather than Markdown anchors. So they are case-sensitive to the headings that are linked and spaces become hyphens. For Example:

Rather than the Anchor "#markdown-in-codex" the Anchor becomes "#Markdown-in-CODEX" so it will render in Confluence correctly.

# Markdown in CODEX

Hi there Codex writers. Here is an article full of interesting facts and quotes written using all the elements of Markdown that you will need to complete an article for Codex.
Please feel free to cut and paste these examples into your work. If you find new and exciting Markdown that is useful to Codex please update this page with an interesting fact, quote or even joke illustrating the Markdown snippet that you wish to include.

# Basic Syntax (H1)

## Basque (H2)

### Aspaldiko (H3)

- Aspaldiko describes the euphoria and happiness felt when catching up with someone you haven’t seen in a long time. (normal text)

#### (H4 text is basically normal bold text)

## Japanese - Words

### Wabi-Sabi

- Japanese concept that represents finding beauty in imperfections.

## South African - Africaans

### Nou-nou

- An indefinite time in the near future. It could be near, like within a minute or two, or not so near, like within an hour or three. This time-telling isn't an exact science at all—it's a non-committal way of giving someone a time.

## Swedish

### Fika

- _A traditional break from work usually involving a drink of coffee or tea. (Italic)_
- _In Swedish offices, you are strongly expected to take a fika, no matter how busy you are. You should not discuss business matters. (Alternate Italic)_

## Spanish

### Querencia

- **Describes a place where we feel safe, a ‘home’ (which doesn’t literally have to be where we live) from which we draw our strength and inspiration. (Bold)**

## French

### Bricoleur
>
> ‘A bricoleur is someone who starts building something with no clear plan, adding bits here and there, cobbling together a whole while flying by the seat of their pants.’ (Blockquote)

## Finnish

### Raaskia

- To have the heart, courage to do something. ~~Because at the end of the day, that’s what it’s all about.~~ (Strikethrough)

## Danish

(Ordered List)

1. Arbejdsglæde
   2. Pronounced [ah-bites-gleh-the], this compound word is make up of arbejde meaning ‘work’ and glæde meaning ‘happiness’ so arbejdsglæde literally means ‘job joy’, ‘job satisfaction’ or ‘happiness at work.’ It’s the heightened sense of happiness, fulfilment, and satisfaction you get from having a great job.
2. Hygge
   3. Pronounced [HEU-guh], Hygge is a well-known Danish term that describes the emotional warmth created by relaxing in the company of loved ones such as good friends and family. Hygge usually involves spending the evening at home, and getting cozy by candlelit with warm blankets, and maybe some alcohol. Watching the glow of a roaring log burner is hygge and so too is building a snowman with your children – however old they are.

## Icelandic

(Unordered List)

- Gluggaveður
  - When the weather looks pleasant from your window, but is actually really cold that you need a jacket. Gluggaveður literally means window-weather.
- Þetta reddast
  - Pronounced [THETTA red-ahst], Þetta reddast is Iceland’s unofficial motto that loosely translates as ‘everything will work out in the end’.
- Tima
  - Being unwilling to spend time or money on a particular thing, even though you can afford it.

# Not so Basic Syntax

## Code

### Single Line of Code

`String joke = "There are 10 kinds of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don’t.";`

### Fenced Code Block

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

_The normal Fenced Code Block does not render correctly on deployment. It is fine when directly applied but the method of conversion renders it as normal text with three backticks_

Alternatively Indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces;

    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "age": 25
    }
