# Contributing to Codex

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ‚ù§Ô∏è

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. üéâ

## I Have a Question

The easiest way to ask a simple quick question is via the slack channel [#sig-tech-codex](https://myob.slack.com/archives/C02N8ADPGUX).
If you think that it needs some more direct attention or discussion:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/codex/issues/new).

Perhaps paste a link to the issue into [#sig-tech-codex](https://myob.slack.com/archives/C02N8ADPGUX) as well if you want more eyes on it.

This is important to do as we don't want you to write or generate lots of content that may be rejected. Always good to ask questions and clarify if needed. Otherwise you can try your luck with a PR with content, but it may be quicker to ask a question first rather than go through rounds of PR review.

## Content Approval

We want many people with many experience levels to contribute to the codex content. This is why we aim for members from across multiple parts of MYOB to be part of the main working groups. But as with all things there needs to be a person or people who are accountable for the content.

Ultimately the responsibility for the methods used at MYOB to deliver software resides with the CTO and the Head of Architecture. These roles will have final say on the content that we approve for release.

## I Want To Contribute

When in doubt if that section / text is needed - ask in slack or raise an issue as described above. If you do want to make a contribution then read below.

### Your First Code Contribution

As this repo is mostly text and GitHub has instructions on how to make PRs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

You can use whatever text editor you feel comfortable with. Most people use Visual Studio Code.

### CHANGELOG

[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) - please include your change under the appropriate section in 'Unreleased'.
`Added` for new content.
`Changed` for changes in existing content.
`Removed`  for now removed content.
`Fixed` for any bug fixes.

### Improving The Documentation and Errors

If errors are clear and obvious, just make a PR. We want this to be as correct as possible, including grammar and spelling etc.

If you can simplify text we also welcome shorter more concise explanations. Please suggest any prose improvements via PR. Everything will be considered if it improves clarity and understanding.
