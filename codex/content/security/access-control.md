# Access Control

#### Level of guidance: Standard

## What is it?

At MYOB, we ensure that only authorised users and systems can access the other systems and resources they need.

Access control is a process to regulate how users and systems interact with other systems and resources, and many different security controls work together to provide this control.

## Why do we do it?

At MYOB, we want to ensure that our teams can build, deploy and maintain the systems they work on, while also preventing unauthorised users and systems from accessing MYOB's assets (such as information, systems, devices, facilities, and personnel).

Implementing access control ensures that users perform their tasks as needed while limiting access to just the right level, enforcing the [principle of need to know](./access-control.md#Principles) and [principle of least privilege](./access-control.md#Principles).

This builds security into our processes, reduces our risks, and enables other security behaviours listed in the Codex.

## How do we do it?

When managing and controlling the access of users (People or systems either internal or external to MYOB) we should ensure that:

- We use the integrated single sign-on systems with existing MYOB onboarding and offboarding processes.
- Users are only granted access to MYOB data and information systems that are necessary to carry out their jobs.
- All online applications must use passwords that comply with the MYOB Password Standard.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enabled for privileged users.
- System owners are authorising access based on documented system access requirements.
- System owners are periodically reviewing user access levels and adjusting them as necessary.
- Every team maintains a documented list of all users/admins within their product and tools.
- Audit trail logging is enabled for all privileged access and usage.
- There is a documented process for how teams can revoke access to users when they leave their teams or leave MYOB.

## Principles

At MYOB, we follow the principle of "need to know" and "least privilege."

1. "Need to know" refers to providing information and access only when there is an immediate need for such access.
2. "Least privilege‚Äù refers to granting access at the minimum level necessary for completing all necessary tasks.
