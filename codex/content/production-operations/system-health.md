# System Health

### Level of guidance

**Default**  
Every system in MYOB is expected to submit a response as part of the Quarterly System Health Census.

## Why do we have this?

Having a structured way to assess systems is useful to assist teams with future prioritisation of effort.
The system health assessment will cover 5 categories:
* Data
* Security
* Operations
* Architecture
* Development

## What does the assessment look like?

Refer to [System Health Assessment](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/x/VxSBKwI) for the latest version that will be rolled out.

**Important to note that this will change over time. The criteria will change as we evolve, so green may turn into amber or red.**
