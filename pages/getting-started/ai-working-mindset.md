# Mindset

## AI Problem Solving Mentality

Think of AI as a helpful assistant that you collaborate with, not something you hand off to. 

Solve problems by collaborating with AI. Prompts are the start of a collaborative process, not a one-off instruction.  

Don't be tempted to hand off to the AI. Break large problems into small problems and collaborate on them. 

## Output must be human-reviewed

All output generated by AI tools — including code, tests, documentation, etc — must be critically reviewed before being accepted into delivery pipelines. 

You're still responsible for anything generated by AI.

## Embrace the Fun and Creativity of AI

Working with AI tools combines productivity with creativity. Teams can rapidly develop production-quality features in novel ways, driving continuous exploration and innovation.

You need to adapt beyond traditional development mindsets to effectively work with LLMs.

## A Generalist Approach to Collaboration

AI development shifts from role-based workflows to a generalist mindset. Team members must work across product, design, development and testing. While domain expertise remains valuable, you need adaptability across disciplines for accelerated AI-driven development.

## Managing Cognitive Load

AI tools create unique challenges:
- High cognitive load from rapid experimentation
- Frequent context switching
- Risk of change fatigue

Reduce these through:
- Regular pairing sessions
- Structured breaks
- Clear priorities
- Supportive team culture

## Effective Prompting

Clear communication with LLMs is essential. They are highly capable but they have no context. Well-crafted prompts give better results. Iterate on prompts to improve outcomes.

Refer to [Prompting Guidance](../appendix/prompt-library/prompting-guidance.md) for details on how to write effective prompts.

## Test-and-Learn Approach

Rather than lengthy iterations, experiment and test ideas quickly. This mindset enables creative exploration without over-commitment. The insights you gain often exceed the value of the code produced.

## Evolving Best Practices

This playbook captures current best practices, acknowledging they will evolve rapidly. Embrace this constant change as an opportunity for growth.

## Key Mindset Shifts

### From Perfectionism to Iteration
- Traditional development: Get it right the first time
- AI development: Iterate quickly and refine continuously

### From Individual Work to AI Collaboration  
- Traditional development: Solo problem-solving
- AI development: Human-AI partnership and dialogue

### From Rigid Roles to Flexible Skills
- Traditional development: Specialized roles (developer, tester, designer)
- AI development: Cross-functional generalist approach

### From Documentation-Heavy to Experiment-First
- Traditional development: Extensive upfront planning
- AI development: Rapid prototyping with lightweight documentation

## Building Your AI Development Skills
