# Project Setup

Set up your development environment to use AI tools safely and effectively.

## Set up your coding assistant

### 1. Install an AI coding assistant

Install a coding assistant from the [Allowed Tools for MYOB Pilot](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md) list.

### 2. Turn on privacy settings

**Important:** You must enable privacy settings to protect MYOB customer data and IP. Privacy settings stop your code and data being stored on AI providers' servers. They also prevent your data being used to train AI models.

For information on approved AI tools and their privacy settings, see the [MYOB-approved AI tools](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md)

### 3. Add AI rules files

Add [Rules for AI](../../pages/appendix/rules-for-ai) to your repository and commit them to version control.

## Set up repository documentation

You need access to artifacts like user stories, technical designs, diagrams and interface designs from within your coding assistant.

### Use GitHub (optional)

Use GitHub (opens in new tab) to manage all your project artifacts centrally. You can add an your project documents into to your code repo or create a separate repo and link to it using [github submodules (opens in new tab)](https://github.blog/open-source/git/working-with-submodules/){:target="_blank"}

You don't want to use GitHub access, you can use another approach that suits your team.
