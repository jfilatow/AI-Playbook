# GitHub Copilot vs Cursor - Comparison Guide

## Overview

Both GitHub Copilot and Cursor are MYOB-approved AI coding tools, but they excel at different things. This guide helps you choose which tool to use for different scenarios, and how to use both together effectively.

## Quick Recommendation

**Use Cursor as your primary AI IDE if:**
- You do complex refactoring regularly
- You need MCP access (Glean, Atlassian)
- You want to choose models (o1, Claude, GPT-4)
- You work with large codebases

**Use GitHub Copilot if:**
- You're deeply familiar with VS Code/JetBrains
- You need simple code completions only
- Your IDE doesn't support Cursor well
- You don't need advanced AI features

**Use both:**
Many MYOB developers use both - Cursor for AI-heavy work, VS Code+Copilot for quick edits.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | GitHub Copilot | Cursor | Winner |
|---------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **Code Completion** | Excellent | Excellent | Tie |
| **Speed** | Very Fast | Fast | Copilot |
| **Chat Interface** | Good | Excellent | Cursor |
| **Multi-file Editing** | No | Yes (Composer) | Cursor |
| **Model Selection** | No choice | Choose models | Cursor |
| **MCP Support** | No | Yes | Cursor |
| **Context Window** | ~8k tokens | Up to 200k+ | Cursor |
| **IDE Options** | Many (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.) | Cursor only | Copilot |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | Medium | Copilot |
| **Enterprise Features** | Excellent | Good | Copilot |

## Detailed Comparison

### Code Completion

**GitHub Copilot:**
- ⚡ Faster suggestions (optimized completion model)
- Context from current file + open files
- Works across many IDEs
- Ghost text inline (less intrusive)

**Cursor:**
- Fast but slightly slower than Copilot
- Larger context (can see more of codebase)
- MCP-enhanced context (from Glean, GitHub, etc.)
- Similar ghost text experience

**Verdict:** Copilot edges out for pure completion speed, Cursor wins on context quality.

### Chat and Questions

**GitHub Copilot Chat:**
- Available in VS Code, JetBrains
- Good for code explanations
- Limited context window (~8-32k tokens)
- Uses GPT-4 class models
- Can't choose model

**Cursor Chat:**
- More powerful chat interface
- Choose models (GPT-4o, Claude, o1, etc.)
- Larger context window (up to 200k+)
- MCP integration (search Glean, GitHub, etc.)
- Better for complex questions

**Verdict:** Cursor significantly better for chat and complex queries.

### Multi-file Refactoring

**GitHub Copilot:**
- ❌ No multi-file refactoring
- Works on one file at a time
- Can't coordinate changes across files
- Manual copy/paste between files

**Cursor:**
- ✅ Composer mode for multi-file editing
- Can refactor across 5-10 files simultaneously
- Maintains consistency across files
- Perfect for large refactorings

**Verdict:** Cursor wins decisively. This is a killer feature.

### MCP and Context Integration

**GitHub Copilot:**
- ❌ No MCP support
- Limited to IDE context only
- Can't access Glean, Atlassian, or custom context
- No way to extend context sources

**Cursor:**
- ✅ Full MCP support
- Access Glean (MYOB docs), GitHub, Atlassian
- Custom MCP integration
- Automatic context enrichment

**Verdict:** Cursor wins. MCPs are game-changing for MYOB developers.

### IDE and Ecosystem

**GitHub Copilot:**
- ✅ Works in VS Code, JetBrains, Visual Studio, Neovim, Vim
- Integrates with existing IDE setup
- No need to switch editors
- Familiar environment

**Cursor:**
- ❌ Only available as standalone editor (based on VS Code)
- Must switch from current IDE
- Learning curve for keybindings and features
- Can import VS Code settings/extensions

**Verdict:** Copilot wins for IDE choice flexibility.

## When to Use Each Tool

### Use Cursor For:

**Complex Tasks:**
- ✅ Large refactorings (5+ files)
- ✅ Architecture questions
- ✅ Understanding large codebases
- ✅ Debugging complex issues
- ✅ Multi-file feature implementation

**Context-Heavy Tasks:**
- ✅ Accessing MYOB documentation (via Glean MCP)
- ✅ Finding code examples in MYOB repos (via GitHub MCP)
- ✅ Referencing Jira tickets (via Atlassian MCP)
- ✅ Questions requiring institutional knowledge

**Model-Specific Needs:**
- ✅ Need o1 for complex reasoning
- ✅ Need Claude 200k for long context
- ✅ Want to experiment with different models

### Use GitHub Copilot For:

**Quick Tasks:**
- ✅ Fast inline code completions
- ✅ Writing boilerplate code
- ✅ Generating simple functions
- ✅ Quick tests generation

**IDE-Specific:**
- ✅ Deep JetBrains integration (if you use IntelliJ/PyCharm)
- ✅ Familiar VS Code environment
- ✅ When switching to Cursor isn't worth it

**Team Consistency:**
- ✅ If whole team uses VS Code
- ✅ Existing VS Code setup and extensions
- ✅ Standardized on GitHub-only tools

## Using Both Together

Many MYOB developers use both tools complementarily:

### Recommended Workflow

**Daily Coding:**
- Use **VS Code + Copilot** for routine development
- Fast completions, familiar environment
- Good for 80% of coding work

**Complex Problems:**
- Switch to **Cursor** for:
  - Complex refactorings
  - Large context questions
  - MCP-powered queries
  - Multi-file changes

**Example Daily Flow:**
```
Morning: VS Code + Copilot
