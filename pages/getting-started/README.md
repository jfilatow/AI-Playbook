# Getting Started

This section explains the core concepts of working with AI tools effectively and safely at MYOB.

## Prerequisites

**Important:** Before you begin, ensure you:

- Use only AI tools from the [MYOB-approved AI tools](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md) list
- Enable privacy settings to protect sensitive data
- Understand the [Responsible Practices](../responsible-practices/README.md) for ethical AI use

Privacy settings prevent your code and data from being stored on AI providers' servers and stop your data being used to train AI models. Always verify these settings are enabled.

## Core Learning Path

Follow this sequence to build your AI development skills:

1. [Workflow](workflow.md) - How the AI development workflow works
2. [The Four Pillars](the-four-pillars.md) - The foundations of consistent code generation
3. [Mindset](ai-working-mindset.md) - How to work effectively with AI
4. [Project Setup](project-setup.md) - Set up your project with the right files, tools, and conventions

## Additional Resources

- [AI Training Programs](ai-training-programs.md) - Available training and certification programs
- [Stakeholder Engagement](stakeholder-engagement.md) - How to involve stakeholders in AI initiatives
- [AI-first Mindset](ai-first-mindset.md) - Developing an AI-first approach to development
- [Self-Service Capabilities](self-service-capabilities.md) - Building self-service AI solutions

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Review [Responsible Practices](../responsible-practices/README.md)
- [ ] Install approved AI tools with privacy settings enabled
- [ ] Complete the [Workflow](workflow.md) guide
- [ ] Understand the [Four Pillars](the-four-pillars.md) framework
- [ ] Set up your first project using [Project Setup](project-setup.md)
