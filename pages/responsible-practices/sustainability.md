# Sustainability

Balance environmental impact with customer value when choosing AI tools for building products and services.

## Why sustainability matters

AI speeds up work and makes our product and services more accessible. But these benefits must not damage the environment.

The MYOB expects you to undestand environmental impact before making AI decisions and choose less energy-intensive options when possible.

## MYOB requirements

### MYOB AI Playbook

Build "safe, secure and robust AI solutions" that remain sustainable throughout their life cycle. AI training and deployment use significant energy and resources.

### Sustainable-by-Design principles

Principle 5: "Take a greener approach to AI and software tools" requires you to:

1. **Choose the right model size** - Pick the smallest or pre-trained model that meets your needs
2. **Use AI only when necessary** - Apply AI tools only when they are the best option and measure their energy use
3. **Adopt green practices** - Use shared tools, low-carbon data centres, and remove unused software


## How to make sustainable choices

- Use smaller, shared or open models when possible
- Pick models trained in low-carbon regions
- Practice mindful prompting - be specific, include only relevant information, and aim to get results right the first time rather than through multiple iterations
- Reuse existing models rather than training new ones
- Schedule heavy workloads for times when the electricity grid uses more renewable energy
- Cache results to avoid repeated processing
- Remove unused resources regularly
- Monitor and measure energy consumption to identify improvement opportunities
- Choose cloud providers with renewable energy commitments
- Document sustainability decisions to help other teams make similar choices
- Share trained models across government departments to avoid duplicate work
