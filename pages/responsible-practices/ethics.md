# Ethics

This guidance helps you use AI tools responsibly while serving the public interest.

## Core principles for AI tool use

### Stay accountable
You remain responsible for all outputs, even when AI tools help create them.

**Do:**
- Review all AI-generated outputs before you use it
- Document AI tool usage in critical systems
- Explain AI-assisted decisions to stakeholders

**Don't:**
- Accept AI outputs without checking them
- Don't rely on AI when you can't explain the 'why' behind important decisions

### Prevent bias
AI tools can copy existing biases, especially from training data.

**Do:**
- Test AI-generated outputs with different scenarios and a diverse set of users (if relevant)
- Check outputs for potential bias in how they work or what they say
- Consider who might be left out by AI-assisted analysis and solutions

**Don't:**
- Assume AI outputs are neutral
- Put AI-generated algorithms into production without bias testing

### Protect data
AI tools may process information in ways that create privacy risks.

**Do:**
- Check what data AI tools collect and how they use it
- Follow best practice data handling requirements when you use AI tools
- Use privacy-protecting alternatives for personal data
- Turn on privacy settings in all tools

For information on approved AI tools and their privacy settings, see the [MYOB-approved AI tools](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md)

**Don't:**
- Put sensitive or classified data into public AI tools
- Use AI tools without understanding how they handle data

## Decision framework

Before you use AI tools, ask:

1. Does this serve a clear user need?
2. Can you explain how you're using AI?
3. Do you accept responsibility for outputs?
4. Have you considered potential bias?
5. Does this protect user data properly?

If you cannot answer "yes" to all questions, change your approach.

## Things to consider

### Security and reliability
AI-generated outputs may contain security flaws or errors that look correct. Always check AI outputs through testing and reviewed.

### Intellectual property
AI tools may generate outputs based on copyrighted material. Make sure AI-assisted outputs follows open source licensing requirements and government IP policies.

### Environmental impact
AI tools use computing resources. Consider environmental costs and use AI tools in proportion to the task complexity.  See [Sustainability](sustainability.md) for more information.

### Skills and development
- Use AI tools to enhance rather than replace human expertise.
- Use AI to enhance your skills and critical thinking rather than replace them

### Public trust
Be transparent about AI assistance in public-facing services. Consider how AI use affects customer confidence in MYOB products and services.
