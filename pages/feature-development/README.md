# Feature Development

This section outlines a streamlined workflow for integrating AI into the software development lifecycle. The workflow focuses on discipline and good practices to deliver quality software for MYOB.

**Important prerequisites:** 

- Complete the [Getting Started](../getting-started) section first
- Use only AI tools from the [Allowed Tools for MYOB Pilot](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md) list
- Configure proper privacy settings. This keeps your sensitive information safe when working with AI tools. For information on approved AI tools and their configuration, see the [MYOB-approved AI tools](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md)

## Core Development Workflow
1. [Context Engineering and Spec Driven Development](context-engineering-spec-driven-development.md) - Systematic information curation and specification-driven approach for AI-assisted development
2. [Development](development.md) - Develop the solution iteratively, using AI for implementation
3. [Test Driven Development](test-driven-development.md) - TDD using AI tools
4. [Testing](testing.md) - Unit testing and journey testing
5. [Refactoring](refactoring.md) - Refactor once feature complete
6. [Documentation](documentation.md) - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes, ensuring clarity and alignment with project goals. Use documentation to give feedback to the AI tools for future iterations

## AI Development Frameworks and Orchestration

Modern AI-powered development leverages sophisticated frameworks for orchestrating AI agents, managing complex workflows, and integrating multiple AI capabilities. These frameworks enable developers to build more sophisticated applications that can coordinate multiple AI services, manage state, and handle complex decision-making processes.

### Framework Categories

**AI Orchestration Frameworks:**
- [AI Agent Orchestration](ai-agent-orchestration.md) - Multi-agent coordination and workflow management
- [AI Development Frameworks](ai-development-frameworks.md) - Core frameworks for building AI-powered applications

**Specialized Orchestration Frameworks:**
- **BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agentic Development)** - Open-source agentic agile framework with two-phase development workflow
- **Agent-OS** - Operating system-like framework for autonomous AI agent systems and workflow orchestration
- **LangChain** - Framework for building applications with large language models and agent capabilities
- **CrewAI** - Multi-agent collaboration framework for team-based AI workflows

### Integration with Development Workflow

These frameworks integrate into the development workflow at multiple stages:
- **Requirements Phase**: Agent-based requirement gathering and validation
- **Development Phase**: AI-assisted coding with orchestrated agent collaboration
- **Testing Phase**: Automated testing using coordinated AI agents
- **Deployment Phase**: AI-powered deployment orchestration and monitoring

## Advanced Topics

- [Continuous Improvement](continuous-improvement.md) - Systematic improvement of AI-assisted development
- [AI-powered Features](ai-powered-features.md) - Building features that incorporate AI capabilities
