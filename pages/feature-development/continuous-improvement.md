# Continuous Improvement for AI-enabled Delivery

Create feedback loops on AI-assisted work:
- Instrumentation: log usage (non-PII), success/error rates, time saved
- Review cadence: retro on AI outcomes each sprint
- Metrics: p50/p95 cycle time deltas, defect escape rate, security findings
- Action: update prompts, patterns, and tools based on data
