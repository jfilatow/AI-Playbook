# Generating Requirements

As per [the four pillars](../getting-started/the-four-pillars.md), AI Coding Assistants (AICA) deliver high quality results when you provide clear requirements.

## What You'll Achieve

This section helps you use AI tools like AI Assistants to create comprehensive requirements for your projects.

Requirements vary widely depending on your situation, for example a brand new greenfield application, or changes to existing live legacy services.

AI can help you with both requirement **generation** and **ideation**, giving you fresh perspectives and approaches you might not have considered.

## Types of Requirements

We split requirements into two main categories, both of which are necessary for AI Coding Assistants (AICA) to deliver high quality code:

**[Product Requirements](product-requirements.md)** - Functional artefacts like user stories and acceptance criteria that define what the system should do

**[Technical Requirements](technical-requirements.md)** - Technical artefacts including data models, APIs and architecture diagrams that define how the system should work
