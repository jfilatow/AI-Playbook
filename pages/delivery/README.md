# Delivery Chapter

Every day, our product and engineering teams are delivering experiences and value to our customers. This could be new features and an improved customer experience. While building our products and systems, we value a set of engineering principles and practices to build quality in, and continuously deliver better outcomes for our customers.

You should start by understanding our [Delivery Principles](./principles.md)

## Practices

The key engineering practices included here cover the lifecycle from code commit to code in production. Each practice will include:

- What is it?
- Why do we have it?
- How do we do it?
- Engineering standards (Optional)
- Templates, Examples, and Sensible Defaults (Optional)

For this chapter, the key practices covered are:

| Practice | Level of guidance |
| :--- |  :--- |
| [Build security in](./build-security-in.md) | Standard |
| [Code review](./code-review.md) | Standard |
| [Continuous integration](./continuous-integration.md) | Standard |
| [Continuous Delivery](./continuous-delivery.md) | Default |
| [Continuous Deployment](./continuous-deployment.md) | Suggestion |
| [Pair programming](./pair-programming.md) | Default |
| [Configuration management](./configuration-management.md) | Default |
| [Data and schema management](./data-and-schema-management.md) | Default |
| [Software deployment](./software-deployment.md) | Default |
| [Feature toggles](./feature-toggles.md) | Default |
| [Infrastructure as code](./infrastructure-as-code.md) | Default |
| [Quality strategy](./quality-strategy.md) | Default |
| [Refactoring](./refactoring.md) | Default |
| [Trunk based development](./trunk-based-development.md) | Default |
| [Change management](./change-management.md) | Suggestion |
| [Release management](./release-management.md) | Suggestion |

|Level of Guidance|What it means|
|---|---|
|**Suggested**|Suggested guidance is provided for MYOB teams to take inspiration from the guidance and adapt to their own context. Teams can choose a different path as needed. We encourage teams to share back what they've learned|
|**Default**|A default in the Codex is stronger guidance. MYOB teams should apply the default guidance in most circumstances, although they may swap in another approach that is better for their context. Teams must not do less than the default, and teams must understand why they are not using the default.|
|**Standard**|A standard is mandated for all teams to apply, with rare exceptions requiring visibility and approval at MYOB SLT level. As our standard guidance evolves, teams must put in place plans to bring systems and ways of working up to meet the standard.|
