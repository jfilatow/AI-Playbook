# Pair Programming

#### Level of guidance: Default

## What is pair programming?

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two developers work together at a shared screen - either in-person or remote. There are two roles: the driver and the navigator. The driver has control of the keyboard and writes code while the navigator continuously reviews the code developed by the driver and offers guidance. The two developers switch roles frequently, and maintain a continuous discussion around how to design and implement the software changes required.

## Why do we use pair programming?

Pair programming offers the following benefits:

- **Collective code ownership** which reduces key person dependencies, and reduces blockers and delays.
- **Code review on the go** which reduces delay to code review feedback, reduces rework, and reduces code decay (code review after the fact is often too late to implement)
- **Shortens onboarding times** for team members rotating or new to team
- **Increases consistency** of code style, design coherence, which reduces maintenance effort
- **Rapidly spreads** developer knowledge productivity tools and techniques, which improves developer effectiveness
- **Increases focus**
- **Builds a resilient work process** - e.g. when someone is sick or called away we have context to continue the work

## Challenges

- Pairing can be an exhausting activity. So it is important to make sure we take breaks and we limit the number of hours that we pair synchronously in a day.

- For someone who is new to this practice, it will initially feel uncomfortable and awkward. But once you learn how to do it, you don't want to go back.

## Decisions to make

- Who should pair with whom?
  - Everyone in the team should have the opportunity to pair with each team member. All different levels of seniority should pair because there are different values in different pairing, even a pair of junior developers will get great value in pairing with each other.

- How often and when should we pair rotate?
  - We should not wait for the story to be done to rotate team members in pairs. We should look to rotate after the pair has been together for two or three days, or when a story or task is completed.

- Do we need to do 'synchronous' pair programming 100% of the time?
  - We should aim to do pair programming as much as possible, as a default practice to unlock the benefits we've described.
  - When a situation demands - including where team members work at differing times or breaks are required, we may do some work separately - however still assigned as a pair. This can be considered 'asynchronous pairing' with short delays in the feedback.
  - When we need to do this, we need to bring the pair back together as soon as possible to review work and continue in the synchronous pair-programming style.

- Are there types of work that don't suit pair programming?
  - Learning and research can suit a bit more of solo style, however this is best to be 'time-boxed' and then brought back to the pair to share what was learned.
  - Be cautious about using 'repetitive work' as a reason to not do pair programming. Firstly pairing can help find creative ways to automate or remove the repetitive work. Also repetitive work can be quite error-prone, so often needs more continuous review!

## How do we do it?

There are multiple styles of pair programming that the engineers can pick and choose from.

Note: Online meeting tools like Microsoft Teams or Zoom are not ideal for pairing remotely and it is better to use specific tools that are built for this.

Completing a story involves all sort of activities, not just coding; attending meetings, documenting, etc. We need to make sure we don't only pair on coding but we also pair on all the activities. This makes sure both members of pair are across one story and where it is at, at every single point in time.
