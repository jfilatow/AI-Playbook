# Process and Governance

---

Technology Process and governance is how we support good technology decision making at MYOB.  Good decisions will make our systems higher quality, easier to maintain and extend, and more reliable for our customers.

This chapter aims to answer questions like these:

* *How do we make technology decisions at MYOB?  Who has to be involved?*
* *What should I document and share? Who do I need to get to review this?*
* *Do I need to record decisions? Where do I record them?*
* *What can I reference to help guide our decisions?*

## Principles

These are the principles that guide how we approach process and governance at MYOB.

We prefer…

* Decisions that are made close to the work *over* centralised decision making
* Broad inputs and transparency *over* checkpoints and approvals
* Interactions and conversations *over* exhaustive documentation
* Last responsible moment *over* detailed analysis months ahead of need
* Use *over* re-use
* Incremental *over* big bang
