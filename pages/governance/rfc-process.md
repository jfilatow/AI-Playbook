# Request for Feedback (RFC) Process 

## What is it & why is it useful?  

The RFC process is a call to seek feedback on a key decision or an overall design. Feedback is a critical aspect for making optimal decisions. For more on the value of making optimal decisions read [here](./decision-framework.md).

## How to use it? 

Some guidelines & recommendations: 
1. RFC is driven by the solution driver. 
2. RFC is not an approval process, it raises organisational knowledge & builds buy-in by giving key stakeholders the opportunity to contribute.  
3. Every Architectural Decision Record or Solution Design paper should be shared here before implementation. 
4. Use [#sig-rfc](https://app.slack.com/client/T02998537/C059YTLJHCZ) on Slack by posting the document. 
5. Identify the right reviewers (not perfect, right). 
6. Set deadlines for inputs. 
7. Seek acknowledgement from key people (even an emoji will do).  
8. Seek alignment, not consensus (dissent is a good thing!).
