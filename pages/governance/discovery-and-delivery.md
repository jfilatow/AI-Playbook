# Discovery and Delivery

## What is it?

[MYOB Discovery and Delivery](https://helpme.myob.com/hc/en-us/sections/14244092684441-Discovery-and-Delivery-Hub) is a framework that guides a product idea from conception through to launch and beyond.

The framework is split into discovery and delivery with a key investment decision point in between. The whole process has six phases that are made of twelve stages. Technology teams make key contributions to a number of these stages.

## Why do we have it?

The Discovery and Delivery framework guides us to make the right level of investment into the stages of discovery and delivery. It helps us start the right things, which means our customers will get the best outcomes and our teams will spend less time jumping between changing priorities.

## What kind of input do technology teams have?

The Discovery and Delivery framework includes work done by all teams at MYOB. The following stages in particular require input from technology teams. The discovery input should come from the teams that will be doing the delivery.

### Ideate (part of Phase 1 - Discovery)

Input from technology teams is cheap and high impact during the Ideate Stage. By providing high level guidance on complexity and feasibility we can help prioritise the best items for further discovery. We can also help come up with and shape great ideas!

Feedback could be as simple as saying: "This will take years!" or "This might not be that hard."

### Solution Assessment (part of Phase 3 - Validate)

Technology input into Solution Assessment involves identifying technical options, costs, risks, and mitigations. This can be viewed as a technical feasibility assessment where the desired outcome is supporting an informed investment decision.

We only need to provide just enough information to proceed to a decision. This means that we don't need to provide detailed technical designs, or make any upfront technology choices. Any decisions that do not materially affect the overall cost or risks of the initiative should be responsibly delayed until the delivery phases.

Over-investing in this stage can lead to wasted effort and assessments that are too detailed to help with decision-making.

### Solution Development (part of Phase 4 - Deliver)

Technology drives the development of an initiative.

This stage begins with Inception, in which teams build a Solution Design. When required, Solution Options can be used help decide on elements of the Solution Design.

During Inception and Solution Development, teams will dig deeper into details. If information is uncovered that materially impacts the costs or risks of the initiative these should be raised immediately to ensure our investment decision remains valid.

Development and ongoing operation of these initiatives should focus on the continuous and sustainable delivery of value as outlined in the [How We Deliver Software at MYOB](../deliver/README.md) chapter of the Codex.
