# Discovery with AI

## Overview

Discovery is where great products begin. It's the process of understanding problems deeply before jumping to solutions. AI tools can significantly accelerate and enhance discovery work, helping Product Managers, Designers, and Delivery teams make better decisions faster.

This section shows you how to use AI throughout MYOB's Double Diamond discovery process to improve product outcomes while maintaining the human judgment and customer empathy that makes discovery effective.

## The Double Diamond Process at MYOB

MYOB uses the Double Diamond framework to structure discovery and delivery:

The process consists of four phases across two key stages:

### Define Problem (First Diamond)
1. **Problem Discovery** (Diverge) - Explore the problem space widely
2. **Problem Definition** (Converge) - Narrow to the right problem to solve

### Design Solution (Second Diamond)
3. **Solution Discovery** (Diverge) - Explore many possible solutions
4. **Solution Validation** (Converge) - Validate and refine the best solution

### Build Solution (Delivery)
5. **Deliver Solutions** - Build, test, and release to customers

Each phase has decision points where teams evaluate whether to proceed, pivot, or stop.

## AI in the Discovery Process

AI tools can enhance each phase of discovery while maintaining human-centered decision making:

| Phase | AI Helps With | Human Critical For |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Problem Discovery** | Market research, trend analysis, interview synthesis | Customer empathy, problem sensing |
| **Problem Definition** | Opportunity sizing, pattern analysis, prioritization | Strategic judgment, stakeholder alignment |
| **Solution Discovery** | Ideation, prototyping, feedback analysis | Creative insight, feasibility assessment |
| **Solution Validation** | Experiment design, data analysis, validation planning | Customer validation, go/no-go decisions |

## In This Section

This section provides practical guidance for using AI tools at each phase of the Double Diamond:

- **[AI for Problem Discovery](ai-for-problem-discovery.md)** - Using AI to explore and understand problem spaces, analyze market trends, and synthesize user research
- **[AI for Problem Definition](ai-for-problem-definition.md)** - Using AI to refine problems, assess opportunities, and prioritize what to solve
- **[AI for Solution Discovery](ai-for-solution-discovery.md)** - Using AI to ideate solutions, prototype concepts, and analyze customer feedback
- **[AI for Solution Validation](ai-for-solution-validation.md)** - Using AI to design validation experiments, analyze results, and make go/no-go decisions

## Key Principles for AI in Discovery

### 1. AI Augments, Doesn't Replace

**Human judgment remains critical for:**
- Understanding customer emotions and context
- Making strategic product decisions
- Building stakeholder relationships
- Sensing problems that data doesn't reveal
- Ethical and values-based choices

**AI excels at:**
- Processing large volumes of information quickly
- Identifying patterns across diverse data sources
- Generating multiple options or hypotheses
- Synthesizing structured insights from unstructured data
- Accelerating repetitive analysis tasks

### 2. Garbage In, Garbage Out

AI quality depends entirely on input quality:
- **Good prompts**: Clear, specific, with relevant context
- **Good data**: Representative, accurate, properly formatted
- **Good framing**: Well-defined problems and clear objectives

### 3. Validate AI Insights

Never blindly trust AI outputs:
- Cross-reference with real customer feedback
- Validate assumptions with market data
- Test hypotheses with real users
- Use AI to generate options, humans to make decisions

### 4. Maintain Data Privacy

Apply MYOB data classification when using AI:
- Never use customer PII or financial data in prompts
- Use synthetic or anonymized data for examples
- Prefer MYOB-approved tools with data protection guarantees
- See [Data Privacy & Security](../responsible-practices/data-privacy-security.md)

## Getting Started with AI Discovery

### For Product Managers

Start here if you're new to using AI in discovery:

1. **Begin with Problem Discovery** - [AI for Problem Discovery](ai-for-problem-discovery.md)
2. **Learn prompt techniques** - See [Prompt Library - Discovery](../appendix/prompt-library/discovery/)
3. **Understand data privacy** - Review [Data Privacy](../responsible-practices/data-privacy-security.md)

### For Delivery Teams Supporting Discovery

Help Product Managers use AI effectively:

1. **Understand the Double Diamond** - Read this overview
2. **Set up AI tools** - See [Getting Started](../getting-started/README.md)
3. **Learn discovery prompts** - Review discovery-specific prompts

### For Designers

Apply AI to user research and design validation:

1. **User research synthesis** - [AI for Problem Discovery](ai-for-problem-discovery.md)
2. **Prototype feedback analysis** - [AI for Solution Validation](ai-for-solution-validation.md)

## MYOB-Specific Discovery Context

### Financial Domain Discovery

When using AI for financial software discovery:

**Consider:**
- Compliance and regulatory requirements upfront
- Security and data privacy from the start
- Financial accuracy and audit trail needs
- Regional differences (AU, NZ, UK markets)

**AI Can Help:**
- Analyze financial industry trends
- Research compliance requirements across regions
- Generate regulatory requirement summaries
- Compare competitor financial product features

**Examples:**
- "Summarize recent changes to Australian tax filing requirements"
- "Analyze common pain points in small business payroll management"
- "Generate user personas for accountants using cloud accounting software"

### Integration with MYOB Discovery Frameworks

This AI guidance complements existing MYOB discovery practices:

- **MYOB Discovery Framework** - Refer to Confluence for full process documentation
- **Customer Research Templates** - AI can help populate and analyze templates
- **Opportunity Assessment** - AI accelerates market and competitive analysis
- **Solution Validation** - AI helps design experiments and analyze results

For MYOB-specific discovery frameworks and templates, see Confluence or contact the Product team.

## When NOT to Use AI in Discovery

AI isn't appropriate for every discovery activity:

**Avoid AI for:**
- Building genuine customer relationships and trust
- Understanding emotional nuance in customer interviews
- Making strategic product bets and decisions
- Sensitive competitive strategy discussions
- Situations requiring deep industry expertise and judgment
- Novel problems with no precedent or training data

**Use Human Judgment for:**
- Final product decisions and prioritization
- Stakeholder negotiation and alignment
- Ethical considerations and edge cases
- Anything involving customer PII or sensitive data

## Measuring AI Impact on Discovery

Track how AI improves discovery outcomes:

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Time saved on research synthesis
- Speed of generating hypotheses and options
- Reduction in repetitive analysis tasks

**Quality Metrics:**
- Breadth of problem space explored
- Number of validated customer insights
- Quality of problem definitions and solution concepts

**Adoption Metrics:**
- PM satisfaction with AI tools
- Frequency of AI use in discovery phases
- Team confidence in AI-enhanced decisions
