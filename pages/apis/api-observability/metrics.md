# Observability Metrics

## Metric Types
Observability aims to provide insights into the health, performance, and behaviour of the system. To achieve this, various metrics can be tracked that can help identify and diagnose issues. Some key metrics that are commonly tracked are as follows :-

- Latency : Measures the time taken for an operation to complete. High latency can indicate performance bottlenecks or network issues.

- Error rates : Tracks the percentage of operations that result in errors. Monitoring error rates helps identify issues.

- Saturation : Monitors the utilisation levels of various resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. High saturation levels can indicate resource bottlenecks.

- Dependency health : Monitors the health and performance of dependencies such as databases, external APIs, or microservices. Tracking dependencies helps identify the impact of upstream issues on the system.

- SLA/SLO compliance : Measures the system's compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Monitoring SLA/SLO metrics helps assess the system's reliability and end user experience.
