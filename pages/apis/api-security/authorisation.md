# API Authorisation

Proper authorisation is a critical aspect of API security that helps to control access to resources and functionalities. By enforcing proper authorisation mechanisms, you can ensure that only authorisation users or systems can access specific API endpoints or perform certain actions.

 - Access Control
    - Proper authorisation allows you to define granular permissions based on roles, groups, or individual users. This ensures that users only have access to the resources and operations that are necessary for their roles or responsibilities. 
    - Least Privilege Principle: Implementing the principle of least privilege ensures that users are granted only the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of unauthorised access to sensitive data or functionalities.

- Data Protection
  - Proper authorisation helps maintain the confidentiality of data by restricting access to authorised users. Unauthorised users are prevented from accessing sensitive information, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches.
  - Authorisation mechanisms help ensure the integrity of data by controlling who can modify or delete it. By enforcing proper authorisation rules, you can prevent unauthorised tampering with data.

- Compliance and Governance
  - Proper authorisation helps organisations comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards related to data protection and privacy. For example, regulations like the Privacy Act and PCI-DSS mandate strict access controls to safeguard sensitive data.
  - Authorisation mechanisms enable organisations to track and audit access to resources and operations. This helps maintain accountability and traceability, which are essential for compliance and governance purposes.

 - Secure Integration
   - Proper authorisation is crucial when integrating with third-party services or APIs. By enforcing access controls, you can ensure that only authorised third parties can access your API endpoints or interact with your system.
