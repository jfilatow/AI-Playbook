# Rules for AI

Most Artificial Intelligence Coding Assistants (AICAs) have the concept of rules for AI. AI Rules define consistent and repeatable standards, patterns and conventions across your codebase. 

Project Rules are committed to version control along with your codebase for consistent use across teams.

Some examples of rules for the programming languages and standards used within Defra are given below. These examples use Cursor, and the documentation can be found [here (opens in new tab)](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules){:target="_blank"}.
