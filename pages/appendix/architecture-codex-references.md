## How AI Tools Help with Codex Standards

### Using AI to Understand Standards

```
Using Glean MCP, search for MYOB API security standards, then:
1. Summarize the key requirements
2. Show me how to implement JWT authentication following those standards
3. Generate code examples that comply
```

### Using AI to Apply Standards

```
Review this code against MYOB's Low Bar Security Requirements.
Specifically check for:
- Secret management (no hardcoded credentials)
- Input validation
- Error handling (no sensitive data in errors)
- Logging (security events logged)
```

### Using AI to Generate Compliant Code

Include standards in prompts:

```
Generate Express.js API endpoint following MYOB API design standards:
- RESTful URL structure
- Standard HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- JSON request/response
- Error response format: { error: string, code: string, details: object }
- Input validation with Joi
- Rate limiting
- Authentication required (JWT)
```

## Integration Patterns

### AI-Assisted Standards Compliance

**Step 1: Find Standard**
```
Search Glean for MYOB database naming conventions
```

**Step 2: Understand Standard**
```
Summarize the MYOB database naming conventions in bullet points
```

**Step 3: Apply Standard**
```
Review this database schema against MYOB naming conventions and suggest corrections
```

**Step 4: Generate Compliant Code**
```
Generate migration script following MYOB conventions
```

### Using MCPs to Access Codex

With Glean MCP configured:
```
@glean Search for MYOB CI/CD pipeline requirements

Then: Create GitHub Actions workflow following those requirements
```

## Common Codex References While Using AI

### For API Development

**Before generating API code:**
1. Search Codex for API design standards
2. Review API security requirements
3. Check API documentation standards

**AI Prompt:**
```
Following MYOB API standards (RESTful design, JSON, standard status codes),
generate an Express endpoint for creating invoices.
```

### For Database Work

**Before schema changes:**
1. Check Codex for data modeling standards
2. Review naming conventions
3. Understand migration requirements

**AI Prompt:**
```
Following MYOB database standards (naming, indexes, audit columns),
generate a Postgres schema for storing expense categories.
```

### For Security Features

**Before implementing auth/security:**
1. Review Low Bar Security Requirements
2. Check authentication patterns
3. Understand audit logging requirements

**AI Prompt:**
```
Following MYOB security standards, implement JWT-based authentication
middleware with proper error handling and audit logging.
```

## Frequently Needed Standards

### Quick Links Table

| I'm working on... | I need Codex guidance on... | AI can help by... |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| New API endpoint | API design, security, observability | Generating compliant code |
| Database schema | Data modeling, naming, migrations | Creating schema following standards |
| Authentication | Security standards, auth patterns | Implementing standard auth |
| CI/CD pipeline | Pipeline requirements, testing | Generating workflow files |

| New microservice | All of the above | Scaffolding compliant service |

## Getting Help

### Finding Standards in Codex

**Use Glean (via MCP):**
```
Search Glean for [topic] standards
```

**Ask in Slack:**
- #architecture - Architecture and design questions
- #svc-security - Security standards questions
- #platform - Infrastructure and deployment questions

### AI-Assisted Codex Search

```
Using Glean MCP, find MYOB standards related to [topic], then:
1. Summarize key requirements
2. Show examples of compliant implementations
3. Generate code that follows these standards
```

## Next Steps

1. **Set Up Glean MCP**: [MCP Usage Guide](../feature-development/mcp-usage.md)
2. **Learn to Search**: Use Glean to explore Codex content
3. **Apply Standards**: Use AI to implement Codex standards in your code
