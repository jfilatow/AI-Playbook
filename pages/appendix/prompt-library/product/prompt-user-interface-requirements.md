# User Interface Requirements

```
I have provided you with  mock-ups of the interfaces as attachments. I have also defined that data model and backend API endpoints below. 

Write the frontend requirements based on the mock-ups I've uploaded. 

Follow GDS standards and give detail about where the pages should sit (route) and any GDS component design elements.

Ask clarifying questions about ambiguities before proceeding.
