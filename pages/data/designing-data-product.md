# Designing a data product

A Data Product Canvas is a visual framework that guides your team through the data product specification. It can be used to establish a structured process of data product design across an organisation. We suggest to fill out this canvas collaboratively. In total, the Data Product Canvas consists of ten building blocks:

* Domain
* Data Product Name
* Consumer and Use case
* Output Port
* Metadata
* Input Ports
* Data Product Design
* Observability
* Common Language (Ubiquitous Language)
* Data Product Type (Classification)
