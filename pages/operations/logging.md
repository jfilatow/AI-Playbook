# Logging

#### Level of guidance: Default 

### What is Logging?
Logging is a crucial aspect of software development and maintenance, providing numerous benefits that enhance the functionality, reliability, and security of applications. Here are some key reasons why logging is important:

- Debugging and Troubleshooting:
  
  - **Issue Identification:** Logs help developers identify where and why an issue occurred. They provide context and details about the application's state at different points in time.
  
  - **Error Tracking:** Logs record errors and exceptions, making it easier to track down the source of a problem and understand its impact.

- Monitoring and Performance Analysis
  
  - **Performance Metrics:** Logs can record performance-related data, such as response times, throughput, and resource utilisation, helping to identify bottlenecks and optimise performance.
  
  - **Operational Monitoring:** Continuous logging allows for real-time monitoring of the application’s health and behaviour, enabling proactive maintenance and quick response to issues.

- Security and Compliance:
  
  - **Security Auditing:** Logs are essential for security audits, tracking access and actions within the system, and detecting suspicious activities or breaches.
  
  - **Compliance:** Ensure we are masking the PI and PII classified data in the logs. More read about [PI and Customer Owned Data](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DASS/pages/1118330300/What+is+PI+and+Customer+Owned+Data).

- Incident Response and Recovery:
  
    - **Incident Analysis:** In the event of a failure or security incident, logs provide a detailed account of what happened, facilitating a quicker and more accurate response.
      
    - **Recovery Support:** Logs can help in recreating the state of the system before a failure, aiding in recovery efforts and minimising downtime.

### How to use it?

- **Logging Best Practice:** Follow logging best practices to ensure that logs are consistent, informative, and actionable. Use meaningful log messages, include relevant context, and follow a consistent log format across the application. More read about [Logging Best Practice](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OD1/pages/9589064235/logging-best-practice).

  - **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging formats like JSON or key-value pairs to make logs machine-readable and easier to parse and analyse.

  - **Log Levels:** Use different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) to categorise log messages based on their severity. This helps in filtering logs based on the level of importance and relevance.

  - **Log Context:** Include relevant context information in log messages, such as timestamps, trace IDs, user IDs, and other metadata that can help in [tracing](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEC/pages/9559278520/Observability+Traces) and correlating logs.
    
- **Log Monitoring:** You may implement log monitoring and alerting to detect anomalies, errors, or dig further into security incidents. One thing to note here is setting up alerts using logs should be the last resort, instead, use metrics to set up alerts. There's some further explanation [here](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/kepler/blob/master/faqs/alerting-from-logs.md). We realise that in the case of trying to monitor third-party software, logs may be all you have.

  - **Log Aggregation:** Sumo Logic is MYOB’s [preferred platform](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEC/pages/8854896963/MYOB+Technology+Defaults) for collecting and analysing logs from multiple sources (including AWS, Azure, Jupiter, etc). This helps in centralising logs, correlating data, and gaining insights into the application's behaviour. The Observability team’s Log Central assists with longer-term storage of logs, beyond Sumo Logic’s 90-day window.

  - **Log Analysis:** Analyse logs to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that can help in troubleshooting, performance optimisation, and security monitoring.

- **Log Volume:**: Be mindful of the volume of logs generated by the application. Excessive logging can impact performance, increase storage costs, and make it harder to find relevant information in logs. For instance, we've seen teams logging 32GB of info per day from a single service, without wondering "is that necessary?" It costs us real money to store and search across large amounts of logs, so we should be mindful of what we're sending, and regularly check in on excessive logging.
