# System Lifecycle

---

At MYOB we have a defined software lifecycle, from creation to decommissioning. Each system in our [System Catalogue](https://system-catalogue.myob.com/) must be tagged with a lifecycle stage. This lifecycle stage can be referenced whenever decisions need to be made - for example integrating to existing systems, or prioritising maintenance and change.

## Scope

This applies to all software used at MYOB, including products we sell, software running our business, and internal software supporting our products.

## Software Lifecycle Stages

Each system should be in one of these states. The state should help inform activities and priorities.

### Active Development

The software is made available for use and consumers are supported and informed of any changes.

This stage involves the creation and testing of the software. Activities include requirement gathering, system design, coding, integration, testing, and deployment. It's a period of intense collaboration between developers, designers, and stakeholders to ensure the software meets its intended purpose. This would also include development of new features or extension of existing features.

### Indefinite Maintenance

Once the software is live, it enters the maintenance phase. This involves regular updates and modifications to improve performance, fix bugs, and adapt to any changes in the operating environment or user requirements. Activities include error tracking and debugging, code optimisation, and ensuring compatibility with any new hardware or software.

### Active Decommissioning

This stage involves planning and executing the process of retiring the software. Activities include identifying and notifying affected users, providing support for data migration or transition to new software, and ensuring all dependencies are properly managed. It also involves the removal of the software from active systems and servers, the archiving / deletion of necessary data and decommissioning any related infrastructure..

### Decommissioned

Once the system / software is decommissioned, it's no longer in use or maintained. Activities in this stage are minimal and may include maintaining archival data, handling any legal obligations related to the decommissioned software, and ensuring that all references to the software are removed from company systems and documentation.
