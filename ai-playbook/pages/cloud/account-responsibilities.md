!!! If you own a cloud account, these are the top 3 things you should be concerned with as an owner.


## Understand what’s running in my account

Tagging your resources with `myob:system` and their SysCat system id will help, especially in shared accounts

If you and your team find something running in your account and you don’t know what it is, you should ask.

## Understand my costs

Use the inbuilt or offered reporting tools to understand costs in your account.

Forecast any cost changes on a regular basis, e.g.

* Will you be adding more services in here, or removing any in the near future?

* What kind of growth do you expect as your service takes on more customers?

Tagging your resources will help, especially in shared accounts.

### Understand and act on Automated Advisor recommendations

Cloud platforms offer automated Advisor recommendations. They will give you prioritised, actionable recommendations around:

* Cost
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance
* Operational Concerns

This should provide a useful backlog of tasks to prioritise alongside your teams' other custodianship work.
