# Feature Development

This section outlines a streamlined workflow for integrating AI into the software development lifecycle. The workflow focuses on discipline and good practices to deliver quality software for MYOB.

**Important prerequisites:** 

- Complete the [Getting Started](../getting-started) section first
- Use only AI tools from the [Allowed Tools for MYOB Pilot](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md) list
- Configure proper privacy settings. This keeps your sensitive information safe when working with AI tools. For information on the appropriate privacy settings for your chosen AI tool, see the [MYOB Tools Guidance](https://MYOB.github.io/ai-sdlc-tool-guidance/)

## Workflow
1. [Development](development.md) - Develop the solution iteratively, using AI for implementation
2. [Test Driven Development](test-driven-development.md) - TDD using AI tools
3. [Testing](testing.md) - Unit testing and journey testing
4. [Refactoring](refactoring.md) - Refactor once feature complete
5. [Documentation](documentation.md) - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes, ensuring clarity and alignment with project goals. Use documentation to give feedback to the AI tools for future iterations
