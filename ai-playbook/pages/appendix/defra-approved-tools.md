# MYOB-approved AI tools

Use only AI tools from the [MYOB Tools Guidance](./tools-guidance.md){:target="_blank"}. This guidance lists vetted tools for the MYOB AI pilot.

## Why we have allowed tools

Using allowed tools ensures:
- your work meets government security standards
- data protection requirements are met
- tools work effectively within MYOB's technical environment

## Request a new tool

To use an AI tool not listed in the guidance:

1. Contact the AI Capabilities and Enablement team before using any unlisted tool. Find contact details [here](../../README.md)
2. Explain why you need the specific tool
3. Wait for approval before proceeding

The team will assess the tool against MYOB's security and compliance requirements.
