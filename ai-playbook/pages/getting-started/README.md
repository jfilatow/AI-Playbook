# Getting Started

This section explains the core concepts of working with AI tools.

**Important:** Use only AI tools from the [Allowed Tools for MYOB](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md) list. 

**Important:** Enable privacy settings to protect sensitive data. Privacy settings stop your code and data being stored on AI providers' servers. They also prevent your data being used to train AI models. This is normally done by default, but always remember to check this is in settings. 

For information on the appropriate privacy settings for your chosen AI tool, see the [MYOB Tools Guidance](./tools-guidance.md)
