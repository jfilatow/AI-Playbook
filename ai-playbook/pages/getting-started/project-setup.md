# Project Setup

Set up your development environment to use AI tools safely and effectively.

## Set up your coding assistant

### 1. Install an AI coding assistant

Install a coding assistant from the [Allowed Tools for MYOB Pilot](../appendix/MYOB-approved-tools.md) list.

### 2. Turn on privacy settings

**Important:** You must enable privacy settings to protect government data. Privacy settings stop your code and data being stored on AI providers' servers. They also prevent your data being used to train AI models.

For information on the appropriate privacy settings for your chosen AI tool, see the [MYOB Tools Guidance](./tools-guidance.md)

### 3. Add AI rules files

Add [Rules for AI](../../pages/appendix/rules-for-ai) to your repository and commit them to version control.

## Set up repository documentation

You need access to artifacts like user stories, technical designs, diagrams and interface designs from within your coding assistant.

### Use Obsidian Vault (optional)

Use [Obsidian (opens in new tab)](https://obsidian.md/){:target="_blank"} to manage all your project artifacts centrally. You can add an obsidian vault to your code repo or create a separate repo and link to it using [git submodules (opens in new tab)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules){:target="_blank"}

You don't have to use Obsidian, you can use another approach that suits your team.
