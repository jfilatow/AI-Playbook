# Production Operations

In essence, the goal of Production Operations is to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the software system in the production environment.

This section is focused on several key topics:

[**System Health**](system-health.md): The ability to define the health of your system across several key measures.

[**System Lifecycle**](system-lifecycle.md): Understanding what phase your system is in to assist with work prioritisation and to manage expectations with the wider company around support.

**Incident Management**: This includes identifying, responding to, and resolving issues that arise in the production environment.

**Disaster Recovery Planning**: Developing, testing and maintaining strategies and procedures to recover the system in case of a disaster event.

**Cost Management**: Ensuring your solution is cost effective and can forecast cost.

**You Build It You Run It (YBIYRI)**: This concept describes how teams who build systems, run those systems in production including support, bug fixing, patching cost management etc.

**Documentation**: Ensuring key aspects of the system are documented. e.g run books, deploy and development set ups, user guides etc
