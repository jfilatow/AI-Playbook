# System Cost Management

### Level of guidance

This will become **Standard** guidance for Technical System Owners.

## What is Cost Management?

Understanding the cost of the systems you run and operate is critical. This understanding encompasses not just the cloud costs, but also any associated licenses or fees that are incurred in running a system in production.

## Why is it Important?

1. **Budget Management**: Understanding the cost of your systems helps in effective budget management. It allows teams to plan and allocate resources efficiently, preventing overspending and ensuring cost-effectiveness.

2. **Cost Optimisation**: Knowing where your money goes can highlight areas for cost optimisation. This could be through more efficient use of resources, identifying cheaper alternatives, or eliminating unnecessary expenses.

3. **Value Assessment**: By understanding the cost, teams can better assess the value a system provides. This can guide decisions about whether to continue investing in a system or consider alternatives.

4. **Responsibility and Accountability**: When teams are aware of the costs associated with the systems they build and run, it fosters a sense of responsibility and accountability. It encourages teams to build more cost-effective and efficient systems. This aligns with our [YBIYRI](YBIYRI.md) model and is a responsibility of a [TSO](../process-and-governance/technical-system-ownership.md).

5. **Transparency**: Having a clear understanding of all costs associated with a system promotes transparency. It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear picture of the financial implications of running the system.

6. **Pricing Strategy**: For a SaaS business, understanding system costs is crucial for pricing products. It ensures that the pricing covers the costs and generates a profit, preventing the business from running at a loss. 'Cost of goods sold' (or COGS) is key in pricing our software. Knowing production costs is key in this calculation.

7. **Customer Value Proposition**: Knowing the cost of running your systems can help in articulating a compelling customer value proposition. It can help in demonstrating the value customers get for their subscription fees.

8. **Business Scaling**: Understanding your costs can inform strategies for scaling your business. It can help identify what resources would be needed to scale and what the cost implications would be.

Understanding the cost of your systems is not just about keeping track of expenses. It's about making informed decisions, optimising resources, delivering value, and pricing your products effectively. So, as you build and run your systems, take the time to understand all the associated costs.
