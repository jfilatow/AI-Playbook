# Vulnerability Management

#### Level of guidance: Standard

## What is it?

A **vulnerability** is any defect in a product or system that an attacker could exploit to access internal resources. This includes issues related to code, external packages, or architectural design choices.

**Vulnerability management** is the process of reducing risks from potential vulnerabilities. It involves detecting, reporting, mitigating, and remediating vulnerabilities in our products and systems.

## Why do we do it?

The core principle of security is building trust in a system. Compromises often occur due to vulnerabilities that could have been prevented with timely patching. By effectively managing vulnerabilities, we strengthen trust in our systems and ensure their security.

## How do we do it?

The Vulnerability Management process consists of four key steps:

- **Detecting**: Testing products and systems against custom security criteria, known vulnerabilities, or industry best practices.
- **Reporting**: Creating a prioritised list of vulnerabilities, understanding their sources, impacts, and affected areas.
- **Mitigation**: Implementing controls to reduce short-term risks associated with vulnerabilities.
- **Remediating**: Making changes to products and systems to address vulnerabilities or providing justification for why a vulnerability may not be a threat in specific circumstances.

MYOB provides various security capabilities to detect vulnerabilities in its systems and products, either on-demand or integrated into delivery pipelines.

We prioritise a high-velocity approach, encouraging teams to keep systems updated frequently. Additionally, teams are urged to use defect management processes to prioritise and manage remediation efforts.

If you find a vulnerability, you must report it. Please follow the [MYOB Vulnerability Management Process Document](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/l/cp/ua8WoDE9) for details on how to report.

High Risk and Critical Risk vulnerabilities have specific processes for reporting, mitigation, and remediation. MYOB Service Level Agreements may also necessitate near-instant action to address these vulnerabilities.

Engage with the Security and GRC team to get help, and refer to the [MYOB Vulnerability Management Process Document](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/l/cp/ua8WoDE9) for more information.

## Principles

1. Regularly update your systems to mitigate, resolve, or prevent vulnerabilities. Frequent updates make the process easier over time.
2. Always report vulnerabilities promptly; sooner is better than later.
