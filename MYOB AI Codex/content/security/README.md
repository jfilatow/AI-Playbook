# Security Chapter

MYOB product and engineering teams are working on new features and customer experiences every day, and this ever-increasing complexity means that it becomes more and more important to consider security daily in our products and systems.

Security equals confidence and trust from our customers in MYOB to keep their information safe, but security also means effort and planning that is taken away from features and customer experiences.

The security team at MYOB wants to establish a set of guiding principles, practices, and sensible defaults to simplify the developer experience, increase the security of our products, and build trust and confidence with our customers.

Security is here to help, and you should reach out if you have questions or queries. Strong relationships with security build stronger products and systems.

## Practices

For this chapter, the key practices covered are:

| Practice | Level of guidance |
| :--- |  :--- |
|[Access Control](./access-control.md)|Standard|
|[Application Security Testing](./application-security-testing.md) |Standard|
|[Information Classification](./information-classification.md)|Standard|
|[Logging](./logging.md)|Standard|
|[Secret Management](./secret-management.md)|Standard|
|[Secure the Infrastructure](./secure-the-infrastructure.md)|Standard|
|[Security in Cross-Functional Requirements](./security-in-cross-functional-requirements.md)|Standard|
|[Threat Modelling](./threat-modelling.md)|Standard|
|[Vulnerability Management](./vulnerability-management.md)|Standard|

|Level of Guidance|What it means|
|---|---|
|**Suggested**|Suggested guidance is provided for MYOB teams to take inspiration from the guidance and adapt to their own context. Teams can choose a different path as needed. We encourage teams to share back what they've learned|
|**Default**|A default in the Codex is stronger guidance. MYOB teams should apply the default guidance in most circumstances, although they may swap in another approach that is better for their context. Teams must not do less than the default, and teams must understand why they are not using the default.|
|**Standard**|A standard is mandated for all teams to apply, with rare exceptions requiring visibility and approval at MYOB SLT level. As our standard guidance evolves, teams must put in place plans to bring systems and ways of working up to meet the standard.|

For definitions of commonly used terms, please refer to the Glossary.

One of the most valuable external resources you can utilise is the [Security Low Bar](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/security/pages/8903622866/Low+Bar+Security+Requirements).

It details tools and practices that should be considered the bare-minimum, must-be-followed across MYOB.
