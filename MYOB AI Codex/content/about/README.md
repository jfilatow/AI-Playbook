# About the MYOB Technology Codex

The MYOB Technology Codex (or the Codex for short) is our handbook, describing how we do engineering and architecture across MYOB.

The Codex contains definitions, principles, and guidance, defines our engineering standards, and captures the approaches and patterns that we use by default.

It will be trustworthy and authoritative because it has a well-defined process for contribution and peer review. We will maintain active working groups, and will regularly review and update the content.

## Who is the Codex for?

**Teams building and maintaining systems**

Teams will be able to make faster well-informed decisions, using the guidance in the Codex.

**Teams investing in continuous improvement**

The Codex will give teams guidance on which areas they can improve their practices and system quality. By outlining good practices it will set minimum engineering standards and expectations for improvement.

**New team members**

The Codex will be useful for onboarding new staff to MYOB. It will help with understanding our core engineering and architecture practices.

**Not just technical folk**

The material in the Codex will be accessible to a wide audience, especially principles and practices linked to business outcomes.

## How to read the Codex

Searching for relevant content is probably the best way. Reading from cover to cover is not how this content was designed. Searching and using Glean are your best bets.

## How can I apply Codex guidance?

This is a fairly clear "it depends" answer. Applying Codex recommendations can be challenging or easy depending on the team and the thing you're attempting to improve on.

Here are some suggestions on how to apply or raise awareness within a team.

!!! tip
    Begin by having Codex discussions on your team. Fortnightly may be a good start. Pick a time and pick a random topic to discuss as a team. Attempt to understand what the outcomes are of the guidance and what challenges you or your team may face in working towards those outcomes. Those insights can help in understanding where you should direct effort to get to the desired outcomes.

!!! tip
    Use System Health reports to assist with identifying areas to improve. Any Red or Amber statuses you could cross check that item to guidance in the Codex.

## Codex Structure

The Codex is composed of multiple chapters that are viewable from the [Codex main README.](../README.md#chapters-and-contents)

Each chapter is made up of multiple _sections_ that will provide:

| Section Content | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| **Definitions**| What do we mean by {term} at MYOB?|
| **Principles**| What do we value in our products, systems, processes? Why do we choose certain approaches and make certain decisions? |
| **Practices**| What practices should we use in planning, designing, delivering and maintaining our systems?|
| **Engineering Standards** | Specific rules that we must follow.|

### Levels of Guidance

Content within the Codex - particularly practices - will be annotated with a "Level of Guidance." This indicates how standardised adoption of this guidance should be within MYOB.

|Level of Guidance|What it means|
|---|---|
|**Suggested**|Suggested guidance is provided for MYOB teams to take inspiration from the guidance and adapt to their own context. Teams can choose a different path as needed. We encourage teams to share back what they've learned|
|**Default**|A default in the Codex is stronger guidance. MYOB teams should apply the default guidance in most circumstances, although they may swap in another approach that is better for their context. Teams must not do less than the default, and teams must understand why they are not using the default.|
|**Standard**|A standard is mandated for all teams to apply, with rare exceptions requiring visibility and approval at MYOB SLT level. As our standard guidance evolves, teams must put in place plans to bring systems and ways of working up to meet the standard.|

Broadly we want more Defaults than Standards, as this allows for teams to apply good judgement within context. It also allows for evolution - as teams encounter situations where the current default guidance is insufficient, they can extend and innovate.

Innovation and evolution needs to be managed within the MYOB Technology Radar process, and teams contribute back with what they are learning. As new defaults and standards emerge, they will be incorporated into the Codex.

## How do I contribute to the Codex?

The Codex is being developed here at MYOB, sponsored by the Head of Architecture. There is a working group focused on each chapter.

- Please join [#sig-tech-codex](https://myob.slack.com/archives/C02N8ADPGUX) on Slack to follow the latest updates and content for review.

- You can raise issues or PRs in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/codex).

- If you are interested in joining one of the chapter working groups, please email <codex@myob.com> or have a look at the [Opportunity Hub](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEC/pages/8818721690/Opportunity+hub#Codex-Working-Groups).
