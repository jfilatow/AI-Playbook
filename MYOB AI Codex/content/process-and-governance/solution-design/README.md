# Solution Design

## What is it?

Solution Design is a practice that enables teams to explore, refine & decide on the optimal solution for a problem to be solved. It describes standard processes so teams can be highly collaborative, drive decision making and have a shared view of how we will solve a problem. The outcome of applying this practice should be a clear path forward for all stakeholders of a problem.

Solution Design supports our Discovery and Delivery process. It can help teams navigate through each stage by:

- Capturing the state of their current understanding
- Tracking important decisions as we progress through [D&D Process](../discovery-and-delivery.md)
- Tracking unknowns/unanswered questions

## Why is this useful to us?

Solution design ensures thorough and educated decision making. It does this by:

- Optimising effort expended on devising a solution
- Standardising the process for navigating simple to complex solutions
- Ensuring outcome-based decisions
- Building transparency around decision making
- Bringing feedback from experts and stakeholders via [#sig-rfc](https://app.slack.com/client/T02998537/C059YTLJHCZ)  
- Ensuring we have fewer regrettable decisions
- Lifting organisational knowledge by creating a historical record of decision making
- Allowing new context & historical knowledge to inform decision-making

As a practice, solution design declares a standard process, definition and expectations across MYOB on the process of building a solution to a problem.

## How do we Solution Design?

We have a standard [template](https://myobconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEC/pages/9344548939/Template+-+Solution+Design) for building Solution Design. These should start small and layer on more details as teams work through context, decisions & overall design.  

***Note***: Our understanding of solutions is always evolving, and hence any decisions made within the solution design are not set in stone. The practice also supports iterations on solutions.
