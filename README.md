# AI Software Development Lifecycle Playbook

**Personal fork by Jerzy Filatow** - Based on MYOB AI Playbook  
**Repository:** https://github.com/jfilatow/AI-Playbook

This playbook is a practical guide for implementing AI-assisted software development workflows. It combines proven SDLC practices with AI-specific guidance, responsible practices, security requirements, and technical best practices to enable safe, efficient, and high-quality AI-powered development.

## About This Fork

This is a personal working copy forked from the [MYOB AI Playbook](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/MYOB-AI-Playbook), which is the official MYOB AI Delivery Playbook. This fork allows for personal experimentation, customization, and contributions while maintaining connection to the upstream sources.
